            <h2 class="md:text-2xl"> 
                The E-2 visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows foreign nationals from certain
                treaty countries to enter the United States for the purpose of investing a
                substantial amount of capital into a U.S. business and obtaining a non-
                immigrant visa that is renewable. This visa is designed to promote foreign
                investment and facilitate the movement of individuals who contribute to the
                American economy.

                E-2 Visa Eligibility Requirements
            </h2>
			<p class="pt-12 text-xl">
                Although the specific eligibility requirements for the E-2 visa may vary
                depending on each individual’s case, the general eligibility requirements all
                applicants can expect are:			
				<br><br>
			</p>
				
			<List  class="text-xl">
                <li> <b>Nationality:</b> The applicant must be a national of a country that has a
                    treaty of commerce and navigation or a bilateral investment treaty with
                    the United States. Not all countries qualify, so it’s essential to check the
                    list of eligible treaty countries on the U.S. Department of State website
                    or contact or office. </li>
                <li> <b>Substantial Investment: </b>The applicant must invest a substantial
                    amount of capital in a U.S. business. The investment must be sufficient
                    to ensure the success of the business, and the specific amount
                    considered “substantial” can vary depending on factors such as the type
                    of business and its scale. It has to be more than just enough to provide
                    a living for the investor. The applicant has to be investing in a real
                    business. </li>
                <li> <b>Active Management:</b> The investor must typically play an active role in
                    the management of the U.S. business. An active role could mean
                    having control and ownership of at least 50% of the enterprise, being
                    involved in making major decisions, and overseeing day-to-day
                    operations.  </li>
                <li><b> Business Type:</b> The investment must be in a bona fide enterprise, and
                    the business should not be marginal. The enterprise must have the
                    capacity to generate more than enough income to provide a minimal
                    living for the investor and their dependents.</li>
                <li><b> Source of Funds:</b>  The E-2 applicant must prove that the funds
                    invested in the U.S. business have a legitimate source. This helps to
                    ensure that the money used for the investment was obtained legally. </li>
			</List>
